               This is a great rom-com anime which has many wholesome aspects and depicts a wonderful romance between
               Hori-san and Miyamura. The interactions between them and their frends is amazing and has many funny
               moments
               especially when Hori gives in to some of her more masochistic tendencies.

               This anime is amazing and will shock you from the very first episode. The writing is wonderful and the
               interactions between the different characters is great. I really like how the main characters act and
               interact with each other especially Aqua and the girls that he meets.

               This is a cute but somewhat weird anime. It is an anime about a romance between two high school students,
               Chihiro who is obssessed with zombies and Rea who had taked Chihiros "zombifying medicine", died and
               became
               a zombie.

            <dd>
               This is a great "harem" romance manga where the plot of it is that the main character Keima is forced to
               save people from being possesed by girls at the threat of death and the only way to do so is to make them
               fall in love with him.

            </dt>
            <dd>
               This is a great manga which starts off as mostly just a harem romance mange but slowly transforms into
               something like a fighting/ fantasy manga which has a great story and amazing characters.

               Kanojo ni Naru Hi
            </dt>
            <dd>
               This is a romance manga between a man and a woman who used to be a man before being afflicted with a
               disease
               which has the effect of turning him into a woman. It is a somewhat short manga but very full of drama and
               romance.
