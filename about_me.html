  <h2>My Top 3 Anime:</h2>
   <h3>Horimiya </h3>
    <p id = "in_collumn">
	 This is a great rom-com anime which has many wholesome aspects and depicts a wonderful romance between Hori-san and Miyamura. The interactions between them and their frends is amazing and has many funny moments especially when Hori gives in to some of her more masochistic tendencies.
    </p>
   <h3>Oshi no Ko</h3>
    <p id = "in_collumn">
	This anime is amazing and will shock you from the very first episode. The writing is wonderful and the interactions between the different characters is great. I really like how the main characters act and interact with each other especially Aqua and the girls that he meets.
    </p>
   <h3>Sankarea</h3>
    <p id = "in_collumn">
	 This is a cute but somewhat weird anime. It is an anime about a romance between two high school students, Chihiro who is obssessed with zombies and Rea who had taked Chihiros "zombifying medicine", died and became a zombie.
    </p>

 <div class = "collumn3">
  <h2>My Top 3 Manga:</h2>
   <h3>The World God Only Knows</h3>
    <p id = "in_collumn">
	 This is a great "harem" romance manga where the plot of it is that the main character Keima is forced to save people from being possesed by girls at the threat of death and the only way to do so is to make them fall in love with him. 
    </p>
   <h3>Mahou Sensei Negima</h3>
    <p id = "in_collumn">
	 This is a great manga which starts off as mostly just a harem romance mange but slowly transforms into something like a fighting/ fantasy manga which has a great story and amazing characters.
    </p>
   <h3>Kanojo ni Naru Hi</h3>
    <p id = "in_collumn">
	 This is a romance manga between a man and a woman who used to be a man before being afflicted with a disease which has the effect of turning him into a woman. It is a somewhat short manga but very full of drama and romance.
